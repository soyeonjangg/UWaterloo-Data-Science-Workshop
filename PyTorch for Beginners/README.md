## PyTorch for Beginners
This workshop was prepared by Soyeon Jang in Winter 2024 - first solo workshop!! 
The goal of this workshop was to introduce PyTorch. Although the initial intention was to introduce PyTorch and Deep Learning, the workshop turned out to be for people with some knowledge in deep learning and using this as a stepping stone to get some exposure to PyTorch.
